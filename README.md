# gotta_code
Create/save teams of Pokemon with evolution info

# Description
Motivation
Our motivation is to build a Pokémon site that allows users to discover the evolution levels and methods for each Pokémon.

Purpose
This app aims to provide a tracker for finding out what level or how your Pokemon evolves, as well as for building a team you like.

Problem Solved
We got the Pokemon data, full CRUD, running well, and a working login and sign-up. The person's information is kept in the database so they can log in and out anytime. The teams are also saved on what Pokemon you want; you can have more than one team and delete the team when you don't want them. 

Lessons Learned
Understanding Node.js and its capabilities.
Utilizing the terminal for project management and debugging.
Unique Features
This project lets users pick Pokémon and view their evolution details, including the required levels, items, and conditions.
