  Motivation - 
Our motivation is to build a Pokémon site that allows users to discover the evolution levels and methods for each Pokémon.

Purpose - 
This app aims to provide a tracker for finding out what level or how your Pokemon evolves, as well as for building a team you like.

Problem Solved - 
We got the Pokemon data, full CRUD, running well, and a working login and sign-up. The person's information is kept in the database so they can log in and out anytime. The teams are also saved on what Pokemon you want; you can have more than one team and delete the team when you don't want them. 

Lessons Learned - 
Understanding Node.js and its capabilities.
Utilizing the terminal for project management and debugging.

Unique Features - 
This project lets users pick Pokémon and view their evolution details, including the required levels, items, and conditions.
