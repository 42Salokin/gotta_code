# Description
Motivation
Our motivation is to build a Pokémon site that allows users to discover the evolution levels and methods for each Pokémon.

Purpose
This project was built to understand how to use Node.js and other web technologies.

Problem Solved
This project addresses the need for accurate function use and correct spelling to ensure smooth functionality in Node.js applications. It has helped improve spelling accuracy and understanding of function usage.

Lessons Learned
Understanding Node.js and its capabilities.
Utilizing the terminal for project management and debugging.
Unique Features

Installation
Prerequisites
Node.js
Git
Steps
# Installation
What I did was open git labs, and I made a git clone of the challenges I had to do into a separate folder, which I then made into my Challenges folder. 
After that, I went into my git hub, created repositories for my Web-API, and connected them with my challenges folder using git bash. I also created my assets folder there.
Then, I open the folder using Visual Studio code to make my index.html and style.css, and Javascript to use my project.
I used my git bash to commit my work and pushed each time I made something new in my Task-Board project. I also used weather API to get the key.
